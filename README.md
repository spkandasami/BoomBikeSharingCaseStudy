## General Information
- It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- Multiple Linear Regression technique is performed on the dataset provided.
- We have studied the effect of the independent variables like Temperature, Year, Holiday, Weekday, Humidity etc on the Bike sharing business.
- Dataset obtained from US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes


## Conclusions
- R-squared value of the train set is 83.72% while the R-squared value of the test set is 81.80%. It depicts that our model broadly explains the variance
  quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.
- Mean Squared Error of both train and test data set is almost zero. So, our model can predict the cnt variable precisely.
- Independent variables like Temperature/Feel like Temperature, Year, Holiday, Humidity, Windspeed are playing crucial role in the Bike-sharing business.
